## Task
Make a UI using client-side technologies which accepts input (characters and numbers only) from user. 

After submit button is clicked, display output as a single string removing all the duplicate characters.

E.g., for string S = “apple”, output is “aple”.


## Process
* I first looked through different inspiration of designs similar to a simple form on Dribbble.com

### Inspiration
* https://dribbble.com/shots/15056942-Merch-ideas-for-the-studio
* https://dribbble.com/shots/11583564-Mobile-Sign-Up-Form
* https://dribbble.com/shots/14765335-Sign-in-Sign-up-form-Mobile
* https://dribbble.com/shots/10993480-Sign-Up-Components
* https://dribbble.com/shots/14126196-Contact-Form-01

### Design
* I then mocked up a quick idea of how to display the UI Elements on the page. These were created using Procreate on the iPad Pro 10.5".
Ran the illustration through TinyPNG to optimize the file size.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naomijustin/shift8-codetest/main/images/UI-Mockup.png"></td>    
  </tr>
 </table>

## Code
* In the actual application of the code for removing duplicate, I originally created a loop, and then inside a secondary loop to check against to find duplicates.
* However, issues happened with displaying the code in the string and posting in the lower section of the form
* Attempted to store in an array and push to the end of the array, then convert to a string, however did not successfully work
* Finially, started to try the .split(), .filter(), and .join() methods however ran out of time while learning about these functions.

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
 
## Illustrations
